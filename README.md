For this project you'll be creating a portion of a product listing page.
Please use any libraries or frameworks that will help you achieve the best
result in the most reasonable amount of time. We're open to HTML/CSS/Javascript,
jQuery, Angular, React, Vue or whatever. It's important to us that you can
explain why you chose certain technologies but much less important what those
techs are.

Style:
 * This page does not need to be responsive.
 * We use Gotham as our typeface, please choose a suitable substitute
 * The circle behind the key image is #f7f7f7 & 140px in diameter
 * The "Proceed to Checkout" button is background color #9b9b9b when disabled
 * Active buttons are #ff6241; This includes the +, - and "Proceed" buttons
 * The Light blue color is #b4e9f2

Functionality
 * We should easily be able to run and manually test this small app.
 * The user should never be able to set a quantity to a number less than 0
 * The "Proceed to Checkout" button should become active when at least one key
   has been added
